# Superunknown


## About

Simple Java Web framework based on Jersey, Netty, Logback and Gson.

It's actually just a Glue between these libraries - and apart from this, it's not much opinionated.

## Getting start

```java
public class App {
    public static void main(string[] args) {
        new Application()
            .register(myresource.class)
            .start();
    }
}
```

You just need to create a new application, configure it/register your resources and start it.

If you want an OOP approach, you can extend the Application class and implement the ``initialize()`` method, which is called before the application start.

```java
public class App extends Application {
    public void initialize() {
        this.register(myresource.class);
    }

    public static void main(string[] args) {
        new Application()
            .start();
    }
}
```

See [Application.java](https://github.com/daniloqueiroz/superunknown/blob/master/src/main/java/superunknown/Application.java) for more about how to get started.
